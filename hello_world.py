# Practice file to be pushed to my github repository
print("Git is Awesome!")

# Update: after attempting to push this file to my repository, I got an error
# and after further research, I found that due to the README file that was in
# the repository already, I could not push the file directly without using
# the "force" command. Therefore, I decided to attempt the pull command and
# merged the repository to my local git repository. I then pushed it again
# and it worked! I modified this file and pushed it again, for some extra
# practice.
